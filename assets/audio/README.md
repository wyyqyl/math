# Audio Files for Encouragement Messages

This directory should contain wav audio files with encouraging children's voices.

Required files:
1. amazing.wav - "Amazing!"
2. on_fire.wav - "You're on fire!"
3. brilliant.wav - "Brilliant!"
4. fantastic.wav - "Fantastic!"
5. superb.wav - "Superb!"
6. excellent.wav - "Excellent!"
7. outstanding.wav - "Outstanding!"
8. incredible.wav - "Incredible!"
9. perfect.wav - "Perfect!"
10. awesome.wav - "Awesome!"

These should be recorded with enthusiastic, encouraging child-friendly voices.
Each file should be 1-2 seconds long.

For now, the app will work without these files (gracefully handling missing audio).
